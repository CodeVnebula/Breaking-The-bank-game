>>> Henry Stickmin tumbled into the tunnel And just when he thought things
couldn't get worse, he heard the unmistakable sound of an approaching train, 
                        HE WAS IN TRAIN TUNNEL!
With a whoosh and a honk, Henry found himself face-to-face with the fastest mode 
of transportation known to man. 

> 'Well,' he thought as he braced for impact, 
> 'at least I can tell my grandkids I once raced a train!'

And with that, Henry Stickmin was about to become the newest member
of the 'Train Surfing' club whether he liked it or not!
