As Henry Stickmin disguised himself as a money bag (don't ask how he tied it
from the inside), he laid low on the road to the bank. When a bank truck rolled 
up, two guards came of to see the bag:
  
  guard 1 >> Hehh? How did we loose one?
  guard 2 >> I think we should throw it in the back, just to be safe?
  
Then they tossed him inside with the cash. In the bank safe, surrounded by money,
Henry celebrated his 'Genius'... until he triggered the security lasers with his
head and got caught.
 
 The guards came in safe: >> Freeze, don't move!!!
                                                
>>> Looks like Henry Stickmin is in a big trouble

Talk about a sticky situation!
